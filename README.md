# AutoScore
Automatically get FREE sheets of specific user on mymusicsheet and more.

## Motivation
[HalyconMusic(ハルシオン Anime Piano Covers)](https://www.youtube.com/@HalcyonMusic) is an exceptionally talented piano content creator. Not only does he produce high-quality videos, but he also generously shares his sheet music for free for a limited time after his videos' release. To prevent missing out on the free sheet music due to a busy personal life, I created this repo to get freesheets of but not limited to him. However, whenever I have time, I make sure to support the channel by liking, giving coins(bilibili), favoriting and leaving a comment. So even if using the flow, let's not just be passive viewers.

## Method
Use RSS to get user's free sheets and auto download them. Finally we send files via email or upload to onedrive. The sensitive data is saved in Github repo's secrets thus it's safe. 
Note: If you want to enable uploading to onedrive: see [About Onedrive](#About-Onedrive).

## Usage
Though this repo origins from a need to download Halycon's sheets, We plan to support any composer's free sheet on mymusichseet and more.
But please note that this repo is still under developing, you may fail to get their sheets when trying to subscribe other users due to some problem on the upstream RSS (Related RSS on RSSHub: [mymusicsheet-UserSheets](https://docs.rsshub.app/routes/shopping#mymusicsheet)).
To subscribe another composer or more composers, please modify the `subscriptions` file in the repo, the format is `mms|USERNAME`(Each composer occupies a line). We subscribe HalcyonMusic's free sheets by default. Open an issue if you face problems, and pr is welcomed. (Though I think few guys can find here without advertising...)

### Use Github Action
1. Fork the repo
2. Use your own information to set the needed secrets in your repo(Repo Settings -- Secrets and variables -- Actions -- Secrets). You need an email with SMTP host, port, account and app password. Check out [User config](#User-config) for the full config we need.
![](docs/add_secrets.png)
3. Enable Workflow r/w permissions
Settings -- Actions -- General
![](docs/enable_rw.png)
4. Allow the actions to run on your forked repos:
a. Actions-->click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
![](docs/allow_action.png)
b. Enable the auto download workflow: auto download-->Enable workflow
![](docs/enable_schedule.png)
Then the action will be triggered when pushing to repo or reaching a certain time everyday. The latter can be set in the auto_download.yml.
To test whether your config is correct, you can run a test immediately following the steps below:
![](docs/try_workflow.png)
If you enable the email sending and set your mail data properly, you should receive an email with run data. You can also check the history running results from the actions tab.

### Use Docker
1. Download the config file:
```
wget https://github.com/Freddd13/auto-Halcyon/blob/main/localconfig.yaml?raw=true -O .localconfig.yaml
```
2. Replace your own data in the yaml above. Check out [User config](#User-config) for the full config we need.
3. Enable Workflow r/w permissions
3. Download image and run:
```
docker pull fredyu13/auto-halcyon
docker run -d --name auto-halcyon -v $(pwd)/.localconfig.yaml:/app/.localconfig.yaml fredyu13/auto-halcyon:latest
```

### User config

## Note
### About RSS
Currently the repo depends on [MMS user route rss from RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/routes/social-media#youtube-user). It's recommended to replace the domain with your self-hosted rsshub url, because the public hub can sometimes be banned by source sites. Besides, self-hosting one is quite benefit for your other future usage. If you don't have one, you can use the default url `https://rsshub.app/`.
For more info, please check [RSSHub doc](https://docs.rsshub.app/).


### About Onedrive
To save to onedrive, you need to create an app in [Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#home). Note that currently only onedrive business international is tested.
Check out [here](auto_score/onedrive/README.md) for detailed instructions of getting required data.
The onedrive needs a login for the first time, after that the token will be saved to `_refresh_token`. As I have no idea how to receive auth callback in github action, the code assumes there's already a token file with token. Thus you need to run on local first to generate the token file. 
For github action:
1. Fork this repo,
2. Follow [Run locally](#Run-locally) (clone your own repo) to run once.
3. Check if the token file generates successfully, and push the code with token file to your repo.
```bash
git add _refresh_token && git commit -m "add token" && git push
```
4. Follow [Use Github Action](#Use-Github-Action)


### About Email
The `enable_email_notify` is used to send you downloading result including sheets and app log. If you disable the email, there's still another way to save your sheets: remove the `MMS_savefolder_path` directory if it exists in the `.gitignore`. The action will update the downloaded sheets to your repo. But it's not a good behavior to share others' sheets without permission, thus it's not recommended to disable email before other uploading method is supported.


## TODO
- [x] Email notification
- [x] Ignore History downloaded sheets
- [x] Docker support
- [x] Save to Onedrive/Cloudreve
- [ ] Gumroad support
